[[Dev  -  Sec???  -  Ops]]

1.  Plan: This is the initial phase where the team plans what they want to build and how they will build it. Security is considered from the start, with potential risks and threats being identified and addressed. [[Plan]]
    
2.  Develop: In this phase, the team writes the code for the software. Security is integrated into the development process through secure coding practices and regular code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    
3.  Build: This is where the software is compiled and built into an executable form. Security is integrated into this phase through automated security testing to detect and address any vulnerabilities.
    
4.  Test: In this phase, the software is tested to ensure that it works as intended. Security testing is also conducted to identify any potential security issues.
    
5.  Release: This is the phase where the software is released to the public. Security is integrated into this phase through final security checks and reviews before the software is made available to users.
    
6.  Deliver: This is where the software is delivered to users. Security is integrated into this phase through secure delivery mechanisms, such as secure download and installation processes.
    
7.  Deploy: This is where the software is deployed to the production environment. Security is integrated into this phase through secure deployment practices, such as encrypted communication channels and secure configuration management.
    
8.  Operate: This is where the software is actively used by users. Security is integrated into this phase through ongoing monitoring and maintenance to detect and address any security issues that may arise.
    
9.  Monitor: This is where the software is continually monitored to ensure that it is working properly and that any security issues are detected and addressed as quickly as possible.
