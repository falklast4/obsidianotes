DevSecOps
DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps that includes security as an integral part of the software development process. DevSecOps emphasizes integrating security checks and processes into the development pipeline from the start, rather than trying to add them in as an afterthought.

imagine building a secret hideout with your friends. In a traditional approach, you might focus solely on building the hideout, but in a DevSecOps approach, you would work with your friends to make sure the hideout is secure and well-protected, with things like locks on the doors and windows, and a secret code for getting in.

DevSecOps approach, security is integrated into the development process from the beginning. The developers work closely with the security team to identify and address potential security risks early in the process, such as vulnerabilities in the code or weaknesses in the app's data storage.
