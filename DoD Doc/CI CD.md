A CI/CD orchestrator is a tool that manages the automation of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. It coordinates the different tools and stages of the pipeline, ensuring that everything is executed in the right order and that feedback is given throughout the process. Some examples of CI/CD orchestrator tools are:

1.  Jenkins - An open-source CI/CD orchestrator that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different projects.
    
2.  CircleCI - A cloud-based CI/CD orchestrator that is easy to set up and use, with a focus on speed and reliability.
    
3.  GitLab CI/CD - A built-in CI/CD orchestrator that is part of the GitLab platform, which provides a complete set of tools for software development.
    
4.  Bamboo - A CI/CD orchestrator from Atlassian that integrates well with other Atlassian tools, such as Jira and Bitbucket.
    
5.  Travis CI - A CI/CD orchestrator that is popular among open-source projects, with a focus on ease of use and flexibility.
    

These CI/CD orchestrator tools can be used in conjunction with other DevSecOps tools to create a streamlined, automated software development pipeline that can help ensure the quality, security, and reliability of mobile apps.
