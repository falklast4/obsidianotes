1.  Organization:

-   Creating cross-functional teams that include developers, security professionals, and operations personnel
-   Encouraging communication and collaboration between team members to ensure that security is built in throughout the development process

Example: An organization creates a team that includes developers, security professionals, and operations personnel who work together on a mobile app project. They hold regular meetings to discuss security concerns and collaborate on ways to implement security measures throughout the development process.

2.  Process:

-   Implementing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes to ensure that new code is continuously tested and delivered to production
-   Conducting regular security reviews and risk assessments throughout the development process

Example: A mobile app development team uses a CI/CD process to ensure that code changes are regularly tested and delivered to production. They also conduct regular security reviews and risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them before they become a problem.

3.  Technology:

-   Implementing security tools and technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems
-   Using automated testing tools to identify security vulnerabilities in the app

Example: A mobile app development team implements encryption and firewalls to protect user data and uses automated testing tools to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

4.  Governance:

-   Creating policies and standards that outline security requirements for the app
-   Conducting regular audits to ensure that the app is compliant with industry and regulatory standards

Example: An organization creates policies and standards that outline specific security requirements for their mobile app, such as data encryption and secure authentication. They also conduct regular audits to ensure that the app is compliant with industry and regulatory standards such as GDPR or HIPAA.
