DevSecOps is like a special team that helps make sure software (like apps and games) is safe and works well. It combines three important parts of software: development (making it), security (keeping it safe), and operations (making sure it works well).

The goal of DevSecOps is to make sure software is good for people to use by doing things like checking it for problems, making it quickly, and updating it when needed. This helps make sure software is safe and works well all the time.

There are different ways to measure how well DevSecOps is working, like how fast new features are made and put in the software, how often it breaks, and how fast it can be fixed when it does break. These measures help people know if the software is good enough for people to use.

DevSecOps is special because it tests for safety and how well it works at the same time. This helps make sure it's safe to use right from the start. There are also some special tools that can automatically make the software safer without the people making it having to do extra work.
