-   Software Factory: This is like a special place where software is made. Think of it like a workshop where people build things, but in this case, they're building software.
    
-   CI/CD Pipeline: This is like a conveyor belt that moves the software from one stage to the next. It starts with the code that people write, and it goes through different stages like testing and deployment until it's ready to be used.
    
-   CI/CD Pipeline Instance: This is like a single run of the conveyor belt. Every time the software goes through the pipeline, it's like a new instance.
    
-   Environment: This is like a special place where the software can run. Think of it like a playground where people can test the software to make sure it works before they release it to the public.
    
-   Software Factory Artifact Repository: This is like a storage room where the software is kept. Whenever someone makes a new version of the software, they put it in the storage room so it can be used later.
    
-   Containers: These are like special boxes that hold the software and everything it needs to run. They're like a portable package that can be moved from one environment to another.
